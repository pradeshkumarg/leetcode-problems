# Intuition  
- The sub-directories always gets nested from the parent folder name and ends with `/`. 
- The intuition is when we sort the inputs, the parent comes first followed by the sub-directories. 
  
# Approach  
- Iterate through the input
- Element that appears first is a directory, the sub-directory of it if present compes next.
- All sub-directories can be ignored and not added to result array
- If you find a directory that doesn't start with a parent, that's a new parent and need to be aded to result array. Continue until visiting all folders.
  
# Complexity  
- Time complexity:  
	O(n log(n)) - Input is being sorted once and traversed once
  
- Space complexity:  
	O(1) - No extra space apart from result
  
# Code  
```python3 []  
class Solution:  
    def removeSubfolders(self, folders: List[str]) -> List[str]:  
	    folders.sort()  
	    temp = folders[0]  
	    result = [temp]  
	    for i in range(1, len(folders)):  
	        if not folders[i].startswith(temp + '/'):  
	            result.append(folders[i])  
	            temp = folders[i]  
	    return result
```
